x = """
Forward value inside any three-number (x, y, z) triple.
It uses the same units as its parent field to show downrange distance or speed.
X starts at the location of impact and increasing toward the target along the aim line.
"""

y = """
Sideways value inside any three-number (x, y, z) triple.
Positive y means right of target and negative means left.
Y starts at the location of impact and increasing right of target along the true level plane.
"""

z = """
Up-and-down value inside any three-number (x, y, z) triple.
Positive z is above the ground and negative z is below it.
"""

[definitions.en.inputs]
ball_speed_meters_per_second = """
How fast the golf ball flies right after impact, measured in meters per second.
A higher number usually means a stronger strike.
"""

horizontal_launch_angle_degrees = """
Shows if the ball starts left or right of the target, measured in degrees.
Negative is left, positive is right.
"""

vertical_launch_angle_degrees = """
Tells how high the ball leaves the club, measured in degrees above the ground.
Higher launch angles make the ball climb faster.
"""

spin_axis_degrees = """
The tilt of the ball’s spin that makes it hook or slice, measured in degrees.
Zero means no curve, while a big tilt bends the shot.
Negative is draw/hook spin (ball curves left), positive is fade/slice spin (ball curves right).
"""

total_spin_rpm = """
Total amount the ball spins per minute.
More spin can add height or curve depending on the tilt.
"""

[definitions.en.clubhead_values]
club_speed_meters_per_second = """
Speed of the club head at impact, measured in meters per second.
More club speed usually means more potential distance.
"""

club_face_to_path_degrees = """
Difference between where the club face points and the swing path line, measured in degrees.
Helps explain why a shot curves left or right after impact.
Face to path causes sidespin/spin axis.
"""

club_face_to_target_degrees = """
Degrees between the club face direction and the target line.
It shows if the face was open or closed when you hit the ball.
Negative is closed (pointing left), positive is open (pointing right).
Face to target determines initial ball direction.
"""

club_path_degrees = """
Direction the club head travels through impact, in degrees left or right.
Negative is club moving to the left (Outside-In), positive is to the right (Inside-Out).
"""

smash_factor = """
Ratio of ball speed to club speed.
Higher numbers mean you transferred energy to the ball more efficiently.
A good value is 1.4x, the rules of golf forbid more than 1.5x.
"""

optimal_maximum_distance_yards = """
Theoretical maximum carry distance for this club speed, in yards.
Calculated as 2.4 yards per mph of club speed under ideal conditions.
Used to calculate distance efficiency percentage.
"""

distance_efficiency_percent = """
How much this shot's ball speed achieved of the furthest possible distance under ideal conditions.
Note that launch angles and spin dramatically change carry and total distance.
For driver, you'd like to see 100%.
For irons and wedges, try to maintain a consistent value that should not be 100% because of VLA and spin.
"""

[definitions.en.trajectory_derived_values]
backspin_rpm = """
Backward spin per minute that helps the ball climb and stop.
Too little backspin can make shots fall out of the sky.
Too much backspin causes ballooning shots.
"""

sidespin_rpm = """
Sideways spin per minute that makes the ball hook, draw, face, or slice.
Negative sidespin means the ball curves left, positive means it curves right.
"""

carry_distance_meters = """
Distance the ball flies through the air before first landing, in meters.
It is the part of the shot that clears hazards or sticks on the green.
"""

total_distance_meters = """
Entire distance the ball travels including roll, in meters.
This tells you how far the ball finished from the tee.
You want more total distance on drives, you want this to match carry for approach and wedge shots.
"""

hang_time_seconds = """
Number of seconds the ball stays in the air.
Longer hang time usually means a higher, softer shot.
"""

descent_angle_degrees = """
Angle of the ball’s path as it comes down, measured in degrees.
Steeper angles help the ball stop faster after landing.
"""

peak_height_meters = """
Highest point of the ball’s flight, in meters.
It helps you know if the shot can clear trees or bunkers.
Most golfers have similar peak heights for all clubs, roughly their driver swing speed in feet.
"""

landing_position = """
Three-number landing spot showing downrange distance, sideways distance, and height.
Use it to plot exactly where the ball first hits the ground.
"""

landing_velocity = """
Three-number landing speed that covers forward, sideways, and up-or-down motion.
It explains how hot or soft the ball is moving on impact with the turf.
"""

offline_distance_meters = """
How far left or right the ball finishes from the target line, in meters.
Large numbers mean the shot missed the fairway line by a lot.
"""

[definitions.en.environment_settings]
elevation_meters = """
Course height above or below sea level, in meters.
Thinner air at higher elevations makes the ball fly farther.
"""

humidity_percent = """
Moisture level in the air shown as a percent.
Sticky air can slightly slow the ball.
"""

pressure_pascals = """
Air pressure used for the shot, measured in Pascals.
Lower pressure means thinner air and longer carries.
"""

temperature_kelvin = """
Air temperature for the shot, measured in Kelvin.
Warmer air can help the ball travel farther.
"""

[definitions.en.us_customary_units]
us_customary_units = """
Bundle of the same shot details converted to U.S. customary units.
Use it when your app or golfer prefers miles per hour and yards.
"""

ball_speed_mph = """
Ball speed at launch measured in miles per hour.
It pairs with the metric ball speed so anyone can read the data.
"""

carry_distance_yards = """
Distance the ball flies through the air before first landing, in yards.
It is the part of the shot that clears hazards or sticks on the green.
"""

club_speed_mph = """
Speed of the club head at impact, measured in miles per hour.
More club speed usually means more potential distance.
"""

landing_position_yards = """
Three-number landing spot reported in yards.
It mirrors the metric landing position but in familiar units.
"""

landing_velocity_mph = """
Three-number landing speed given in miles per hour.
It shows how fast the ball is moving as it hits the ground.
"""

offline_distance_yards = """
How far left or right the ball finishes from the target line, in yards.
It equals the metric offline value converted to yards.
"""

peak_height_yards = """
Highest point of the ball’s flight, in meters.
It helps you know if the shot can clear trees or bunkers.
Most golfers have similar peak heights for all clubs, roughly their driver swing speed in feet.
"""

total_distance_yards = """
Entire distance the ball travels including roll, in yards.
This tells you how far the ball finished from the tee.
You want more total distance on drives, you want this to match carry for approach and wedge shots.
