# OpenGolfCoach

A cross-platform library for derived golf value calculations supporting the goal of better golf instruction and understanding.

## What is OpenGolfCoach?

OpenGolfCoach takes basic launch monitor data (ball speed, launch angles, spin) and calculates derived values that game developers and app makers may need for their features.

The goal of this project is to provide open source implementations so that app developers don't need to duplicate effort and users may someday see more consistent results across launch monitor and simulator software for derived values.

Additionally, the derived values include easy to read definitions of many golf terms.  Encouraging users to learn golf terms and have more retention of their coaching and practice is a core mission of this project.

- **Carry & Total Distance** - Where the ball lands and estimated roll-out
- **Trajectories** - Full 3D Twists with adjustable time intervals
- **Spin Components** - Converts total spin + spin axis to backspin/sidespin
- **Shot Classification** - Labels your shot shape (Straight, Push Draw, Pull Fade, etc.) with gamified rankings
